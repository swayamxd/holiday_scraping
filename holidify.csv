Forest covered hills, spice and coffee plantations only add to the landscape.",Mangalore,N/A,"The Kodavas (a local clan in Coorg), are considered to be absolutely the most hospitable people. What makes Coorg as a tourist destination better, is the fact that the Kodavas are markedly different from other cultures. For instance, it is said that attending a Kodava marriage, wherein the ceremony is conducted not by a priest but by the elders of the two families, is considered as an enriching experience. The marriage takes place after the cutting of banana stumps by a representative. Dancing commences on tribal beats and instruments post the feast. The concept of ""Kanyadaan"" is absent. The Kodavas also happen to be different because of their different dressing style. For instance, the women wear their saris in a different way wherein the pleats are tucked at the back, and the loose end of the sari is drawn under the left shoulder and secured over the right. This community also happens to be animal and ancestor worshippers, and have a number of festivals celebrated, the most important of which are: Puthari (harvest festival), Kail Polud (celebrating end of the paddy transplanting season), and Kaveri Sankramana (celebrating the birth of the river Kaveri).

Mumbai is a literal paradise for any foodie, owing to the exquisite range of cuisine, be it the luscious Missal Pav or the lovely Parsi cuisine in some of the heritage cafes. Being the one stop for all the dreams and ambitions in India, Mumbai is aptly called the 'City of Dreams'.The history of the city of Mumbai, or Bombay, began with the signing of the Treaty of Bassein between Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and the Portuguese, who were offered the seven islands that made up Bombay by the Sultan. The islands were initially referred to by several different names, but collectively took the written name of Bombain. The Portuguese built several churches and forts in the city during their reign. With its growing strategic importance as a natural harbour, it attracted repeated British and Dutch interests. In 1661, as part of the royal marriage alliance between Charles II of England and Princess Catherine of Portugal, the islands were given as dowry to the British by the Portuguese. In 1668, the English leased 3 of the islands to the British East India Company, and a few years later, they shifted their capital from Surat to Bombay. Bombay was thus the capital of the Bombay Presidency and quickly gained commercial and military significance. The Portuguese finally left Bombay in the 1730s, following their defeat to the Marathas under Peshwa Baji Rao. Following the Anglo-Maratha war and the signing of some treaties, the British drove out the Marathas and were able to establish their majoritarian supremacy over Bombay. Under the Hornby Vellard project, the islands were unified through significant land reclamation activities into a single landmass. Bombay was extremely active in the political sphere during India’s independence struggle and was part of the Quit India Movement & the Royal Navy Mutiny in the 1940s.Nothing can perhaps be a better yardstick for measuring Mumbai’s diversity and disparity than the fact that the city is home to both Dharavi and Antilia - the former one of the largest slum settlements in the world, and the latter the most expensive residential property of the multi-billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani. Dharavi Once a mangrove swamp and a sparsely populated island, Dharavi in Mumbai is now the second largest slum in Asia, and the third largest world in the world. Founded in 1883 during the British rule, Dharavi expanded rapidly due to rural migration and an explosion of factories in Bombay. According to suggested estimates, the population of Dharavi is said to be between 300,000 to 1 million. The citizens are multi-religious and multi-ethnic, who are engaged in various activities ranging from leather, textiles, pottery and even a growing recycling industry. The informal economy of Dharavi is thriving and goods from Dharavi are exported to many parts of the world, and the total annual turnover from the economy is around USD 1 billion. Despite many plans to resettle the population and develop the place, Dharavi still continues to be plagued by low sanitation and hygiene standards. Antilia The extravagantly expensive home of Mukesh Ambani, one of the world’s richest businessmen, is located in South Mumbai. Named Antilia, after the mythical islands of the same name, it is estimated to have a net worth of over USD 1 billion and is second only to the Buckingham Palace as the world’s most expensive residential property. A daily staff of around 600 are reported to maintain the private residence for the Ambani family.

Mumbai is the commercial and financial capital of India and contributes to 6.6% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

A city that has stayed in place and watched as the world has turned and the tides have changed. A city that has stood the test of time for thousands of years. In the words of Mark Twain, ""Older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, And looks twice as old as all of them put together."" Varanasi, the city that is more than just the spiritual capital of India. The city which can be aptly described as a melting pot where both life and death come together. The city that you only need to visit once for it to stay with you forever. Varanasi is a very popular pilgrimage point for Hindus, and the older part of Varanasi, which has thrived on the banks of the river Ganga, is an integral part of the very infrastructure of the city, with thousands of people flocking there for salvation and purification. All chaos and noise on the ghats of Varanasi take a pause when the Ganga Aarti takes place in the evening, a ceremony of immense grandeur and opulence, with pandits lining up to perform rituals that are no less than a performance for the senses.",Varanasi,N/A,"Like all cities of early India, Varanasi evolved into a major hub because it was located on the side of a river. Trade, commerce, worship, living quarters and daily routines in this city have been heavily influenced by the ways of the Ganga. Even today, it is the main source of water for the city and some amount of navigation takes places across this river. It is also the focus of cultural life and large daily congregations at the Ghats, parks and mosques at the banks of the river form the basis of social life.   Since it attracts a large number of tourists, the Ganga is also responsible for a large part of the city's revenue in the form of tourism. However, due to the industries located near the Ganga, it is getting increasingly polluted and the quality of water is rapidly declining making the water dangerous for human use.At sundown, every evening, Ganga Aarti is performed on the ghats of Varanasi. Although all of them can give you an extraordinary experience, the most magnificent and the spectacular one happens at the Dashashwamedh Ghat. The aarti commences as dawn descends, around 6 PM in winters and 7 PM in summers, to be precise. Devotees usually gather 90 minutes in advance to find themselves a suitable spot. The spectacle is viewed from the ghat steps, from the rooftops of the nearby houses and shops and also from the boats loaded at the riverbanks, all of which offer the best views. It can also be viewed from the rooftop of the organizing committee's office- Ganga Seva Nidhi. The Aarti takes place on seven wooden planks, each of which is decorated with saffron clothes and Pooja items including incense sticks, conch shells, brass lamps, etc. The pooja is performed by seven pandits which involve rhythmic chanting of mantras, hymns and prayers in the praises of river Ganges. Millions of spectators gather to witness the most mesmerising and glorious event of Varanasi. The assembly is a confluence of faith, cultures and traditions coming from all parts of India and even abroad. The aarti ends with the blowing of conch shells and lighting of camphor lamps. The whole spectacle takes around 45 minutes, by the end of which you can see the pandits, the pilgrims and the tourists dispersing and the solidarity and the silence of the river restored.Popularly known as Kashi or Banaras, the quaintly charming land of Varanasi is the oldest living city in the world. It is a centre of Hindu culture and mythology, literature and art. The origin dates back to 2500 years ago when Lord Shiva married Goddess Parvati and chose to make the city their abode. Later the Aryans came and inhabited the city and thus began the trade of silk, muslin, ivory and perfumes. During the Afghan invasion and Muslim rule, Varanasi suffered a destructive phase which involved the demolition and destruction of temples. But it's glory was restored during the rule of Mughal emperor, Akbar.Varanasi has been a part of Indian civilisation since the beginning of time. Successive empires have made this city their trading and cultural hub, and this has brought the city into contact with a broad range of cultures.

A small town located in the Bundelkhand region in,Khajuraho,N/A,"Khajuraho is a cultural hotspot, situated in Chhatarpur district in the state of Madhya Pradesh. This is the site which houses remnants of the glorious history of ancient India, especially the famous series of Hindu & Jain Temples, created by the Chandela dynasty, that spoke volumes of the religious tolerance and generous hospitality that most of the Indians continue to practice for. No wonder why Khajuraho has also been accorded the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.This is a prominent reason for the huge influx of tourists to Khajuraho. This site is chiefly famous for a series of Hindu & Jain Temples, constructed side by side, in a time span between 950 AD & 1050 AD, by the rulers of the Chandela dynasty. The site is an epitome of religious tolerance, with Hindu and Jain Temples coexisting side by side.   A striking feature of this famous site is the erotic sculpture, showing some postures of passionate love, as depicted in Vatsyayana's epic Kamasutra, as engraved on the walls. The best part about Khajuraho is that although scores of plunderers tried to destroy the whole complex, they could never succeed, even though they managed to reduce the number of temples and caves to 25 from a staggering 85 at the time it was created.Chandela rulers built the temples of Khajuraho, one at a time spread over a period of hundred years. The first recorded mention of the temples can be founded in the writings of Abu Rihan-ul Biruni towards the end of the 11th century. Throughout the 12th century, the temple complex grew and later fell into the hands of the Sultan of Delhi, Qutb-uddin Aibak, after the downfall of the Chandela rulers. In the years to follow, the temples were preserved and tended by the Muslim rulers. Over the years some of the temples were vandalised and disfigured and were left unmonitored due to their deserted locations. T.S. Burt, a British engineer, later rediscovered the temples in 1830 and made efforts for their restoration.The Chandela rulers originally built these temples to represent love and lust in the most pure forms. Some sculptures are bound to make you cringe, some will make you awe at the raw art, some will disappoint you and some will leave you in wonder.
There are several stories weaved around the erotic sculptures of Khajuraho. One of these stories suggest that the moon God got allured by the beauty of a maiden bathing in a lake under moonlight. She ran to the forest to seek refuge and raised her son alone. In turn, the moon God promised her son, a kingdom of his own. This theory claims that her son grew up to be the first Chandela ruler and influenced by her mother’s story, got the monuments constructed.
Some theorists believed that the Chandela dynasty used the sculptures as forms of sex education. Some say that the carvings are symbols for “good luck”. Some suggest that the figurines much in love are only carved outside the temple and is a message that says to leave all lust and worldly pleasures behind before entering the temples, which in turn is a metaphor for “moksha” (Hindu theory of salvation).
The sculptures are grouped into five broad categories-
The first ones are the Shilpshastras- the Jain tirthankaras.
The second category represent the deities, attendants, ganas, gandharvas, ashta dikpalas, among other images.
The third category represents the apsaras, also called the sapna sundaris. These are sculptures of really beautiful women doing mundane jobs like holding a baby, painting, dancing or just plain undressing.
The fourth category portrays scenes from everyday life- warriors, dancers, musicians, royal court, teacher, pupil etc.
The fifth and the final category has the very famous erotic images of unnatural sex, group sex etc.The temple complex in Khajuraho is grouped into two categories based on their orientation- Western Group of Temples and Eastern Group of Temples. The Western group is more famous out of the two as it has the largest temple Kandariya Mahadeo Temple which is dedicated to the glory of Lord Shiva. The Western group mainly houses the temples dedicated to Hindu gods and goddesses. Among a large number of temples built in the complex, six are dedicated to Lord Shiva, eight are dedicated to Lord Vishnu, one each to Lord Ganesha and the Sun God, while three are dedicated to Jain Tirthankaras. All of these have beautiful intricate designs and boast of fine architecture and the very famous ever-so-elaborate sculptures.
The Eastern Group primarily has the four Jain temples- Parasvanath, Adinath, Shantinath and Ghantai dedicated to the worship of the Jain Tirthankaras.To shop the right product at the right place, we suggest you visit the local flea markets.
