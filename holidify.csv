There is a lot of culture and history to be seen in the surroundings.

Also, if you plan to enter temples, make sure that you are not dressed in any revealing clothes since temple codes need to be maintained. UbudÂs dress code is more conservative than that of beach resort areas. Some Ubud visitors adopt the Sarong. As far as etiquettes are concerned, always give and receive things with the right hand, never left. Avoid pointing with the index finger, especially at a person: this gesture may be taken as a physical challenge. If you must point something, only use the thumb of your right hand. To be very polite, do so while cupping your right elbow. Never point to anyone or anything with your foot.

Most locals who deal with tourists speak some English and there are guides trained in Japanese and major European languages.Historically, Ubud is a very rich place. Evidences of numerous archeological finds in the area are a proof of its rich culture and history since the time of the Bronze Age. One of the most remarkable artifacts from that time is the bronze gong known as 'The Moon of Pejeng', displayed in Pura Panataran Sasih in Pejeng, east of Ubud. Later in the 8th Century, _a Buddhist priest called Rsi Marhandya came to Bali from Java on pilgrimage with a group of followers and meditated at the confluence of the East and West Wos Rivers meet in Campuan, on the edge of Ubud, and declared the place holy. A shrine was established and later expanded by Nirartha, the Javanese priest who is regarded as the founder of Bali's religious practices and rituals as we know them today. The Javanese Majapahit kingdom conquered Bali in 1343, and the key final victory was against the Pejeng Dynasty centred at Bedulu. This is when the Balinese culture fourished and the ancestry of Ubud's current day aristocratic families can be traced back to this period. In 1900, Ubud became a Dutch protectorate at its own request and the colonialists interfered little, allowing the traditional arts and culture of the area to remain relatively unchanged. The modern era of Ubud perhaps began in the 1930s, when foreign artists were encouraged by the royal family to take up presence in the town.As opposed to what comes to your mind when you think of 'nighlife' with DJs and club music, Ubud serves a rather more ambient and relaxing environment at night to its guests.

Thus, while inspecting a hill known as the Trikut Hill, he got acquainted with a lone sage, Eesul. When Eesul got to know that Jaiswal was descendent of the Yaduvanshi clan, he narrated a myth to the latter, according to which, Lord Krishna had made a prophecy stating that one day a descendant of his clan would establish a kingdom here. Encouraged by this, Rawal Jaiswal established a kingdom here, which eventually came to be known as Jaisalmer (which means ""The Hill Fort of Jaisal"").

Bandung,"Kawah Putih,Tangkuban Perahu,Situ Patenggang Lake,Gedung Sate,Braga Street,",N/A,Indonesia,27.89 deg C,June -September,1 day,"A city of contrasts, Bandung is one of Indonesia's most significant and most rapidly developing cities. Characterized by rippling rice fields, volcanic mountains, and a distinctly European feel, Bandung was dubbed the ""Paris of Java"" by the Dutch colonialists. Due to Bandung's volcanic geographic features that made it easy to defend from attacks, the Dutch East India Company had plans to relocate the country's capital from the erstwhile called Batavia (Jakarta), but those plans fell through because of the Second World War. It has since blossomed into the preferred weekend getaway destination of many Jakartans.",Bandung,N/A,"The Indonesian government identifies six main religions, including Islam and Hinduism. Bandung, like Indonesia, has an overwhelmingly large Muslim population, with pockets of Christianity.IDR is the official currency of Indonesia, and is exclusively used everywhere, therefore all currency must be compulsorily exchanged, for foreign currency is not valid in Indonesia. Credit cards can be used at modern establishments, but for most flea markets and factory outlets in Bandung, cash is advisable.The best places to exchange money is at the airport, and at the DollarAsia outlets in Jalan Cihampelas (near Ciwalk) and Jalan Setiabudi. ATMs are conveniently located in shopping centres, urban office complexes, many convenience stores as well as in areas that tourists frequent.Bandung is a famous shopping mecca, with factory outlets, boutiques, flea markets, second-hand stalls and large malls. The factory outlets, however, outnumber the rest, and this is what Bandung is most known for. Manufacturing rejects, duplicates and imitation goods from brands like Zara and A&F are all found here at cheap rates, and this is why many shoppers around Indonesia flock here. Rumah mode and Cihampelas are two of the concentration points for all factory outlets in Bandung.In Bandung, there are three kinds of nightlife: student, tourist and red-light. Student nightlife include karaoke bars and cheaper bars (like Camden), while tourist bars are a bit on the pricier side (Legacy and Embassy). The red-light district in Bandung is concentrated around Saritung and Jalan Braga, with girly karaoke bars, strip clubs and generally more raucous nightclubs.Bandung is as conservative as the rest of Indonesia, so modest dressing is encouraged. Tipping is prevalent at the cafes and the larger restaurants, but not the traditional establishments.Like the rest of Indonesia, Bandung was also under the Pajajaran dynasty's rule, and after its deposition, under Dutch colonial rule. This again led to a blend of cultures which has affected Bandung's architecture and present culture. After the Indonesian independence, Bandung was named as the provincial capital of West Java.","Bandung can be reached through air, rail and road, but is relatively less connected compared to other major tourist hubs in Indonesia. Therefore Jakarta is always used as a transit point to get to Bandung. Buses operated by transport company Primajasa can take you from¾the Soekarno-Hatta Airport in Jakarta to Bandung. These rides cost around $7. Bandungês¾Husein Sastranegara International Airport is one of the smallest airports in Indonesia and travellers have to alight from the plane on the tarmac. Carriers that operate at the airport include: AirAsia, Garuda Indonesia, Lion Air, and Malaysia Airlines among others. Tentative return flight prices to Bandung from major cities in India: Despite Bandungês bad traffic, it is pretty easy to get a cab, even late at night-metered cabs are recommended for tourists, to decrease chances of overpricing. Taking the Angkot (small colourful vans) is ideal for short trips, as it is relatively cheap and fuss-free. Angkotês come in a variety of colours and passengers flag them as if they were a cab. If youêre unsure of fare rates (usually not more than IDR 7000 for a single trip) or transport routes, seek assistance from the locals.

He fought the second Mysore war in February 1728 where he defeated Col. John Brathwaite. Tipu Sultan succeeded his father in December the same year. He continued his aggression against the British by recapturing Baidanur and Mangalore. In 1784, he settled peace with the British and assumed the title of Sultan of Mysore. Tipu introduced some administrative revolutions during his rule, including his currency, a new Mauludi lunisolar calendar and a new revenue system of land which instigated the development of the Mysore silk industry. Tipu Sultan was a capable general and administrator, and, though a Muslim, he reserved the faithfulness of his Hindu subjects. Tipu Sultan was commonly known as the Tiger of Mysore and adopted this animal as the symbol of his reign. It is said that while he was hunting in the woods with a French companion, he encountered a tiger. His weapon did not work, and his knife fell on the ground as the tiger hopped on him. He went after the blade, lifted it up, and killed the tiger with it. That earned him the name ""the Tiger of Mysore.""Mysore Pak is a delicious sweet dish that is made of roasted gram flour and butter. It is a traditional South Indian sweet dish.

The Hindu temples in the kingdom were constructed in typical South Indian Dravidian style. The city’s main place, the Mysore Palace, was designed by the English architect Henry Irwin in 1897. The design is a combination of Hindu, Islamic, Indo-Saracenic and Moorish styles, which for the first time in India, used cast iron columns and roof frames. One can also find architectural designs from the Renaissance period and exhibits concepts English manor houses and Italian palazzos. These styles can be found in the architecture of the Lalitha Mahal Palace that was built in 1921 by E.W. Fritchley under the commission of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. One can also find buildings constructed in the Greco – Roman style in the Chaluvamba Mansion and theMysore is considered the cultural capital of Karnataka with good reason.

The statue overlooks the Mall Road and the statue can be seen from many parts of the city.Shimla is a heritage city and had been the British's favourite destination to spend the summer, all thanks to the chilled weather of this place back then, that attracted the British from the hot and humid areas.

There is an old world charm attached to this place.Back in the 18th century, Shimla was mostly all forest and trees. The only inhabitation was a temple and a few scattered huts. The establishment was called ‘Shimla’, after a Hindu goddess, Shyamala Devi. The British took over the territory as per the Sugauli Treaty after Bhimsen Thapa of Nepal who ruled then. In 1863, the Viceroy of India, John Lawrence, shifted the summer capital of British Raj to Shimla as a means to cope up with the Indian tropical heat. Later, Shimla became the capital of undivided Punjab in 1871. After the formation of Himachal Pradesh in 1971, Shimla became a part and was announced as the state capital.With tourism at the heart of this hill-station, Shimla is no less than brimming with option for food.

Indore has over the years established itself as the hub of trading and industrial practices in the state. But the charm of this city lies in its rich cultural heritage which has been preserved over centuries. Indore is the quintessential example of a soaring city with countless opportunities which has not lost touch with its history and heritage.",Indore,N/A,"One of the most populated cities of Madhya Pradesh, Indore is a major commercial hub, growing exactly on the same lines, as does India's major commercial capital, Mumbai. However, given the size of both the cities, Indore is aptly nicknamed Mini Mumbai. This city was once ruled by the Maratha scion of Holkars, among whom Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar has a special place in the history of India. Indore is also a major education hub, owing to the city being the seat of both IIT [Indian Institute of Technology] and IIM [Indian Institute of Management]. Very few people know that Indore is also the birth town of star cricketer Rahul Dravid, as well as Bollywood star Salman Khan, who had lived up to five years of his childhood here.Indore witnessed the conflict between the Mughals, Marathas and the British who wanted to gain domination of Central India. Located in the Malwa Region, the city of Indore was founded by Rao Nandlal Chaudhary. On his visit to the Indreshwar temple, he found the area to be sheltered and secured by natural boundaries on all sides. He established the city of Indrapur and built a fortress there. The name Indore is a change of Indrapur.
When the Marathas became powerless after they lost the third battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali, an Afghan invader, they had to sue for peace in order to resist the British. After this, the Holkars established their rule on Indore.
The Holkar Dynasty was founded by one of the greatest warriors of his time, Maharaja Malhar Rao Holkar I. Even during the British Raj, Indore remained as the part of the Holkar Dynasty. During the Independence of India, it joined a few other Princely States and became a part of Madhya Bharat. Later, it became a part of Madhya Pradesh on November 1, 1956.There is very little information with respect to the architecture of the earlier period covering the rules of Shivaji, Sambhaji, Rajaram and Shahu. The prior Maratha rulers had neither the time nor the assets to indulge in such activities because of their extended wars with the Mughals. However, one can get some idea about the features of the Maratha architecture from the later built forts and buildings. The materials that were mostly used for construction were bricks, mortars and stone. The arches were made in the Deccan style, even though their use was kept to a minimum. Some of the decorative features that were commonly used were arches, stone brackets, narrow balconies that are jutting out of these brackets and shallow ceilings in the shape of domes. The Maratha design did not have the excellence and beauty of the structures of the Mughals and the Rajputs. Be that as it may, the Marathas exceeded expectations in fortification engineering. The woodwork they used to enliven their royal residences, and other common structures were intricate and minute.The cuisine of Indore provides one, countless options for lip-smacking vegetarian dishes with a hint of a South-Indian influence on the food. Being a sparkling city and a unique hub of cultures in and around, this town provides one quite a variety. From the hustle-bustle of street food culture to an array of fine dining experiences, all choices here, are equally delicious. The cuisines that you will find here are Maratha, Rajasthani, Continental, Muslim and South-Indian, Bengali and Mughlai.","Indore is well connected to the rest of India by rail, road and air.

Despite repeated efforts over the generations by different Pal rulers, who even received aid from the Mughals, they were unable to annexe the town of Bir back from the Rajas of Mandi. The establishment of the Tibetan monastery marks a new chapter in Bir’s history in the 1960s, with the arrival of Neten Chokling, an incarnate lama of the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. His later incarnations, along with Chokling Rinpoche, contributed to the building of the beautiful and famous Tibetan Monastery, which to this day continues to house many refugees.The Tibetan Colony of Bir, located in the village of Chowgan, was established in the 1960s by Chokling Rinpoche. After the exile of several refugees, including the Dalai Lama from Tibet, there was an influx of them into Bir. Many of the original refugees came from Kham in south-east Tibet. The population of the colony to this day continues to be predominantly Tibetan, but there are also some Indian families and other expatriates. The colony has several Tibetan monasteries. It also has some tourist attractions like the Deer Park Institute, a branch of the Tibetan Medical and Astrological Institute (Men-Tsee-Khang), and a Tibetan handicrafts shop.This is a major reason why scores of tourists visit Bir.

On one hand, it has a proud and vibrant local culture, and on the other, has a relaxing atmosphere and an exciting night life.",Chumphon,N/A,"Koh Tao has plenty of shops selling clothes made by local as well as international designers at all the three top beaches - Sairee, Mae Haad, Chaalok Ban Kao. Swimsuits, hats, and other beach accessories are available here too. Souvenirs like coconut necklaces and printed t-shirts are also easy to find. The fresh markets of Koh Tao offer local foods and ingredients for foreigners interested in trying local cuisine.Koh Tao being a small island, the bars and local vendors prefer accepting cash most of the times. You can carry your debit cards to be able to withdraw extra cash because Koh Tao has ATMs all over the place.One can exchange currency at Koh Tao, but a better option would be exchanging it at Bangkok. While carrying credit cards, one should inform their particular bank that they're travelling to Thailand as the banks sometimes block the cards. ATMs are there all over Koh Tao, so withdrawing isn't a problem.Koh Tao is known for its cheap accommodation and water activities. If you're looking for a relaxing trip by the beach and eating local, you will be done in THB 1000.

The people are expected to be polite and smile. Ideal clothes for this island would be cotton and linen casuals for both, men and women. Tips aren't the norm in Koh Tao. However, maids get paid less so one can tip them with about TBH 30.Thai is the spoken language in Koh Tao. As with any foreign country, learning a few basic communication terms in the local language would be an advantage. The resort and restaurant staff will know English, but the local market vendors might not, so carrying an English to Thai dictionary could come handy at times.Before 1943, Koh Tao was uninhabited. The island was just a jungle with an abundance of turtles. Only fishing boats visited the local waters in search of fish. Between 1943 and 1944, it was also used as a prison for prisoners transferred from Koh Tarutao. However, these prisoners were then released, leaving the island deserted once again. Later in 1977, the first travellers came to Koh Tao to explore its pristine underwaters. Soon after that, the first resort, Niyom Bungalows, was built here, and since then Koh Tao is gaining popularity as a tourist destination.Koh Tao offers more than ten beaches and has a vibrant nightlife. There are a lot of beach bars and clubs to choose from. It also has weekly organised pub crawls which provide an excellent opportunity to meet other travellers.  Some of the best bars are the Lotus Beach Bar and the Fishbowl Beach Bar, both situated in the centre of the Sairee beach.","Koh Tao is a small island so one can reach by taking a flight to Koh Samui or Chumphon and then a ferry. If you're coming from Bangkok to Koh Tao, you can take a bus from Bangkok to Chumphon and then a ferry to Koh Tao. This is a very long journey and hence not usually prefered. But it might appeal to people travelling on a budget. Tourists have the option of flying to either Koh Samaui international airport which is the simplest but very expensive and not usually a choice for budget travellers, or Chumphon international airport which is much cheaper than Samui. Both these airports have high speed ferry connections to Koh Tao. Tentative return flight prices to Chumphon from major cities in India: Boats are the only way to reach Koh Tao. Services run from the mainlands of Chumphon and Surat Thani, and from islands of Koh Samui and Ko Pha Ngnan."

With its elaborate temples, endless coastline, some of the world's best coral reefs, waterfalls and retreats, Bali is indeed a place of leisure and adventurous all in one.",Denpasar,N/A,"Bali is a little conservative when it comes to tradition, and temples- there is a proper dress code that needs to be followed. Shoulders and parts of the upper arm must be covered while visiting a temple. A sarong around the legs and a temple scarf around the waist is also mandatory. Public displays of affection are not appropriate near temples or holy places, and modest dressing is encouraged. Also, it would be advisable to never use the left hand to offer anything to the people or the deities, and using the index finger to beckon someone. It is considered equally rude to touch somebody on the head or step on canang sari (holy offerings) on the street, so tourists must be watchful. Religious processions also take place frequently in Bali, and interrupting these is not appropriate. Flash photography is also discouraged at quieter places. Tipping is a practice in Bali.Â¾The languages commonly spoken are Balinese and Bahasa Indonesian, but almost all the people on the island have at least a rudimentary knowledge of English, so it is relatively easy for tourists to find their way around Bali. Also, the signs in Bali are multilingual, with Chinese and Korean counterparts of English signs.Â¾Bali has been populated since prehistoric times. After the 4th and 5th century, Hindu traders brought their religion to the island, but little else is known about this time. After that Bali was under the Majapahit kingdom ,and many more tumultuous regimes for a while. Different tribes blossomed at this point. Then the landmark time for European colonialism was the 16th century, when Dutch settlers arrived at the city. This influenced many parts of Balinese culture, and created a hybrid of architecture in the area. In 1710, the Dutch people conquered the existing regime, and Bali was brought under their control. Dutch rule was short-lived, however, because Indonesia was soon conquered by Japan during World War II. Since then, Bali has been propped back on its feet by tourism, that boomed in the 19070s.Nightlife at Bali only really starts after midnight, with most of the popular clubs opening around that time. With the western concept of bars and clubbing gaining ground, Kuta and Seminyak are the best places to find popular clubs. Fridays and Saturdays are particularly good days of the week for a night out.Â¾Bali has a distinctive shopping culture, with many different kinds of night markets, art markets, thrift stores, antique stores and of course, Balinese souvenir stores. There are many silver workshops at Celuk and Ubud, and the Ubud Art Market is the most famous art market in Bali. The urban areas are also home to many malls- like the Kuta Beachwalk and Discovery Mall. Kuta and Ubud have many night markets and thrift stores as well, which have cheap and beautiful products.Â¾Rupiah is the official currency of Indonesia, and is used in Bali, but American dollars are also accepted nearly everywhere. Credit cards can be used at modern establishments, but for most flea markets and hawker centres in Bali cash is advisable. ATMs around Bali also accept foreign credit cards.For citizens of the US, it is not imperative to exchange currency, for USD is accepted almost everywhere. However, for every other country, the most reliable exchange takes place in commercial banks for the airport is slightly unreliable.For the traveller on a shoestring budget, about USD 40 is the daily budget, including food and travel expenses. Comfortable travel would require a budget of about USD 60 - 70, and luxury travel would reach upwards of USD 100.Bali is a city where religious beliefs influence almost every aspect of life. It is home to one of the unique forms of Hinduism, even though Indonesia's population is predominantly Muslim. Balinese Hinduism and Buddhism are the most practised religions in Bali, with various temples dedicated to both faiths. Balinese Hindu festivals are different from Indian Hindu festivals, and their customs and traditions are also vastly different.","Bali is best reached from Europe and USA through air.

The town is 11 Km away from the actual line of control and is small enough to be explored by wayfaring. Situated drastically close to the Line of Control, this town, apart from being a tourist hotspot, is also a volatile region, owing to the terrorism prevalent from the other side of the LOC. This was the same region, where India had fought its last war with their neighbour Pakistan in 1999, incidentally the first war in India to have received wide coverage, both in newspapers and on television. Kargil doesn't end here.

To sum up, Kargil is a destination that suits the bold travellers, who want a slice of adrenaline rushing up every moment in their veins.",Leh,N/A,"La dvags rgyal rabs used to denote the present-day territory of Kargil as 'dKal skyil' which is a Tibetan connotation of its original name. Earlier, it was known as Purig, as wars went and multiple dynasties ruled the territory, it’s identity changed in many ways. There are multiple contradictions related to the origin of the word which is why it is still under debate. Kargil is said to be derived from 'Kar' which means castle and 'rKil' which means the centre as in a place that lies among various kingdoms. Another competing theory says it has been derived from 'gar' which means anywhere and 'Khil' a central location where people can reside.Kargil was initially a part of the Baltistan district of Ladakh where it used to provide shelter to Tibetan Buddhists. With the rise of Shia movement in the 14th century, the first Kashmir war resulted in the division of the district and 1947 it became a part of Kashmir. At the end of Indo-Pak war in the 1970s, both the nations signed a treaty called the Shimla agreement which reinforced the cease-fire line as Line of Control (LoC) and pledged to respect the boundary. Pakistan forces in 1999 infiltrated the 160 kilometres long stretch of the ridge which overlooked the road from Srinagar to Leh. After a brief period of diplomacy and war, Pakistan forces withdrew, but the trail of conspiracies didn’t. Another major outlook that made Kargil of great historical significance was its silk route. It was a major gateway for traders and played a crucial role in its early economy.Kargil was occupied by the Pakistani troops in the summers of 1999 and the Indian Military forces left no stone unturned in order to recapture this paradise. The Kargil war continued from 8th may to 5th July 1999, during the course of which several Indian army men sacrificed their lives to protect the country. The bravery of such sort is incomparable.

This is the site which houses remnants of the glorious history of ancient India, especially the famous series of Hindu & Jain Temples, created by the Chandela dynasty, that spoke volumes of the religious tolerance and generous hospitality that most of the Indians continue to practice for. No wonder why Khajuraho has also been accorded the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.This is a prominent reason for the huge influx of tourists to Khajuraho. This site is chiefly famous for a series of Hindu & Jain Temples, constructed side by side, in a time span between 950 AD & 1050 AD, by the rulers of the Chandela dynasty. The site is an epitome of religious tolerance, with Hindu and Jain Temples coexisting side by side.   A striking feature of this famous site is the erotic sculpture, showing some postures of passionate love, as depicted in Vatsyayana's epic Kamasutra, as engraved on the walls. The best part about Khajuraho is that although scores of plunderers tried to destroy the whole complex, they could never succeed, even though they managed to reduce the number of temples and caves to 25 from a staggering 85 at the time it was created.Chandela rulers built the temples of Khajuraho, one at a time spread over a period of hundred years. The first recorded mention of the temples can be founded in the writings of Abu Rihan-ul Biruni towards the end of the 11th century. Throughout the 12th century, the temple complex grew and later fell into the hands of the Sultan of Delhi, Qutb-uddin Aibak, after the downfall of the Chandela rulers. In the years to follow, the temples were preserved and tended by the Muslim rulers. Over the years some of the temples were vandalised and disfigured and were left unmonitored due to their deserted locations. T.S. Burt, a British engineer, later rediscovered the temples in 1830 and made efforts for their restoration.The Chandela rulers originally built these temples to represent love and lust in the most pure forms. Some sculptures are bound to make you cringe, some will make you awe at the raw art, some will disappoint you and some will leave you in wonder.
There are several stories weaved around the erotic sculptures of Khajuraho. One of these stories suggest that the moon God got allured by the beauty of a maiden bathing in a lake under moonlight. She ran to the forest to seek refuge and raised her son alone. In turn, the moon God promised her son, a kingdom of his own. This theory claims that her son grew up to be the first Chandela ruler and influenced by her mother’s story, got the monuments constructed.
Some theorists believed that the Chandela dynasty used the sculptures as forms of sex education. Some say that the carvings are symbols for “good luck”. Some suggest that the figurines much in love are only carved outside the temple and is a message that says to leave all lust and worldly pleasures behind before entering the temples, which in turn is a metaphor for “moksha” (Hindu theory of salvation).
The sculptures are grouped into five broad categories-
The first ones are the Shilpshastras- the Jain tirthankaras.
The second category represent the deities, attendants, ganas, gandharvas, ashta dikpalas, among other images.
The third category represents the apsaras, also called the sapna sundaris. These are sculptures of really beautiful women doing mundane jobs like holding a baby, painting, dancing or just plain undressing.

The city itself is named after the king who founded it in 1727, Maharaja Jai Singh II; he decided to shift his state’s capital city from Amber to present-day Jaipur due to scarce basic amenities and consistently growing population. He wanted his new capital to be so scientifically, culturally, and architecturally accurate that the science and mathematics aficionado took help from a Bengali Brahmin scholar Vidyadhar Bhattacharya to construct a Vastu Shastra compliant city over the course of four years. The most advanced and fortified layout of the city was made, with two out of the nine blocks reserved for palaces and administrative buildings and the rest for the public. The reason behind Jaipur being called “The Pink City” is also an interesting one: The whole city was quite literally dipped in pink paint to welcome the Prince of Wales in 1856 and to continue its otherworldly magical charm, the pink colour is still maintained to this day.

For women, there is black abaya, a loose long robe to cover their usual clothes along with a headscarf known as sheyla. Some women also cover their faces with thin black veil. As a tourist, one is expected to respect the general culture and etiquettes. Public display of affection is not accepted anywhere in U.A.E, although the presence of people from various ethnic groups has lead to the acceptation of other social customs such as man and a woman holding hands.

Sundarban-National-Park,N/A,West-Bengal,India,30.57 deg C,Sep-Mar,1-2 days,"Known for hosting the biggest mangrove forests in the world, Sundarbans National Park is located in West Bengal, India. It is also a Tiger Reserve and a Biosphere reserve that provides a complete nature's circle to the tourist right from 'Royal Bengal tigers' to roaring rivers and beautiful estuaries. Sundarbans National Park is a part of Sundarban delta that is covered with Mangrove Forest and the largest population of the Bengal Tigers. It is a UNESCO world heritage site with a large variety of birds and reptiles including salt-water crocodile. Shared between India and Bangladesh, the Sundarbans meaning beautiful forest, have been declared a UNESCO heritage site. This area has a silent charm that manages to amaze one with the simplicity and naturalness of its ecological balance in spite of offering habitat to some of the most dynamic and awe-inspiring flora and fauna. They are in fact the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles which once covered the Gangetic plain and the sustainability of this natural structure is pretty majestic. Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are over 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30, 000 spotted deer in the area.",Kolkata,N/A,"Sundarban is an island cluster in the Bay of Bengal, spread across an area of 10,000 sq. Km. 40 percent of this area lies in India, and the rest is in Bangladesh. The forest lies in the mid of the humongous delta formed by the rivers Meghna, Ganga, and Brahmaputra.
The park area is also enclosed with different rivers on all sides. The park boundaries are shared by Malta on West, Haribhanga on East, and  Netidhopani & Gosba in the North.
The total park area is 4,262 sq. Km, half of which is covered by the Mangrove trees. Out of 102 islands, 54 are inhabited by forest vegetation and the rest by human dwellers.
Various tributaries of the river Ganga flow through the park many other water courses, including 31 saltwater rivers form a criss-cross of water bodies in the region. All water bodies flow Southward to mingle into the sea.
It’s interesting to note that the region goes through fluctuating geographical conditions, depending on the effect of flow tides and ebb tides. The waxing and waning of tides raise the river bed by depositing slit in varying heights and depths, creating new islands and carving fresh creeks.
To the South of the Park and the Dublar Char island lies the mysterious deep-sea canyon, known as Swatch of No Ground where the depth of water undergoes extreme variations, ranging from 20 metres to 500 metres.
Sundarban is also known for its metamorphosing mudflats. Mudflats are wet deposits of soil found near coastal areas, formed from the deposition of mud by rivers or tides. The mudflats are submerged during high tide and exposed during low tide, transforming within one tidal cycle.
Outside the park, there is a mudflat which is being promoted as an upcoming tourist attraction by private tour operators. During low tide, tourists are seen visiting the mudflat, taking mud baths and even exploring the area on foot. With some luck, small Octopus, Sea Anemones, and Horseshoe Crabs can also be spotted here.To offer a full view of the rich animal and plant life to tourists, the forest department has constructed several towers inside the forest area. Below are the major ones with the sightings they are famous for.Sundarban is made up of a unique ecosystem of Mangrove trees and houses 1586 faunal species. Out of these, 15 mammal species, eight bird species, and 17 reptile species are counted amongst the rare and endangered species in India.Sundarban is diffusion of 54 islands, rooted in Mangrove vegetation. The existence of these islands is a worrisome cause for the nature lovers and conservationists as even the main islands are fast disappearing under the rising seawater levels and global warming. Four islands have completely disappeared under water, and another ten are at the risk of submersion because of increase in river water flowing from the Himalayas from global warming.Here in Sundarban, you will witness a unique culture of communal assimilation. This is where different religious beliefs merge into one, where the sheer force of the forest brings all communities together, and Hindus and Muslims worship the same deities.
Prepare to meet one of the most resilient, hardened community of people you will ever meet. Hardships of living in a remote village take on an entirely new form here as nature cavorts about furiously in the form of extreme tides which wash away homes and predatory animals who prance on humans venturing into the jungle for their livelihood.
In the face of such dynamic natural forces, belief in forest deities and the supernatural is firm and unyielding. Bono Bibi (the forest goddess) is considered to be the protector of the forest dwellers, and everyone who ventures into the forest doesn’t forget to invoke her and seek her blessings and protection.
What is interesting is that everyone, irrespective of their caste or religion worships the forest goddess and other deities such as Maa Manosa, Dakshin Rai, and Gazi Peer.Located between India and Bangladesh, Sundarbans is an alluvial archipelago of 54 islands formed by the rivers Ganga and Brahmaputra. Known as the largest delta in the world, the place receives its name from the Mangrove or 'Sundari' trees which grow in the region in huge numbers. A UNESCO World Heritage Site and a biosphere reserve, the existence of Sundarbans is mesmerizing in itself.  The mysterious mangrove forests are home to the Royal Bengal Tiger and several other species of animals. Sundarbans is a replica of the miracles of nature and shows us the importance of the ecosystem. A trip to Sundarbans is thus, a perfect escape from the hectic life into the lap of Mother Nature. Apart from the natural beauty, the non-communal traditions of the local population in the region gives a strong message to take away home.Though the options for cuisine and food here are modest and limited, one can relish the freshest catches from the water around and indulge in mouth watering dishes prepared from the same. However since the options for restaurants and joints are limited, it is best to stick to your hotels to avail decent food options.","Safaris are available both from Kolkata and Dhaka into the Sunderbans.

Another strand believes in the fact that “Bhedaghat” is the modern name of “Bhairavi Ghat”, where the Shakti Pooja used to take place (after research of some archaeological remains, it has been proven that Bhedaghat was indeed the place where the famous Shakti Pooja used to take place). A few others believe that the modern name came about from the term “Bhada”, which means “meeting” (indicating the confluence of the two rivers: Narmada and Pavananga).What with the beautiful, towering marble rocks, Bhedaghat is often referred to as the “Grand Canyon of India”. Thus, a boat ride in the river Narmada, to have a view of these beautiful marble rocks is a must. Normally, a boat ride takes about 45 minutes to one hour, where the guide takes the tourists to the different scenic locations where a number of Bollywood movies have been shot, and also to the various rocks with interesting colours and shapes. With the boating options open till 7 P.M., this experience becomes even more special under the moon, when the marble rocks have an entirely different show and appeal. So, if there happens to be an evening with a completely moonlit sky, boating in the Narmada river, meandering around these marble canyons is an absolute dream come true!Bhedaghat is known for its marble rock formations which are gigantic and breathtaking when one witness it in real life. From the banks one cannot see the actual formation of the rocks, hence a boat ride in the Narmada is a must. The rocks rise to about a hundred feet on either side soaring and glittering in splendour. The visit to this place is nothing but an out worldly experience which you can only feel and not talk about.Bhedaghat doesn't have much to offer for foodies as it is a small area and mostly visited just for the waterfalls and marble rocks. However, there are few stalls which serve snacks which can cater to the hunger needs of travellers.","Bhedaghat does not have an airport or a railway junction of its own.

Forest covered hills, spice and coffee plantations only add to the landscape.",Mangalore,N/A,"The Kodavas (a local clan in Coorg), are considered to be absolutely the most hospitable people. What makes Coorg as a tourist destination better, is the fact that the Kodavas are markedly different from other cultures. For instance, it is said that attending a Kodava marriage, wherein the ceremony is conducted not by a priest but by the elders of the two families, is considered as an enriching experience. The marriage takes place after the cutting of banana stumps by a representative. Dancing commences on tribal beats and instruments post the feast. The concept of ""Kanyadaan"" is absent. The Kodavas also happen to be different because of their different dressing style. For instance, the women wear their saris in a different way wherein the pleats are tucked at the back, and the loose end of the sari is drawn under the left shoulder and secured over the right. This community also happens to be animal and ancestor worshippers, and have a number of festivals celebrated, the most important of which are: Puthari (harvest festival), Kail Polud (celebrating end of the paddy transplanting season), and Kaveri Sankramana (celebrating the birth of the river Kaveri).

One mention of the name and even a non-visitor would immediately envision the image of Howrah Bridge, which is a world-famous attraction that has not only put the town on the world map but has also made Howrah a significant transportation hub of the state.",N/A,N/A,"Howrah and some neighbouring regions were once ruled by the Bhurshut Kingdom some 500 years ago. Cesare Federici, an explorer from Venice, is said to have visited the region between 1565 – 1578. A proof of this is an old journal belonging to him in which he has mentioned a commercial port and a place called Buttor. Researchers have identified the port to be River Hooghly through which massive ships could sail and Buttor as the present day Bator. The Consultation Book of the Bengal Council (belonging to the time of the British East India Company) also mentions Howrah/ Harirah along with four more hamlets located on the western bank of River Hooghly. The book dates back to 1714 and was made to bring about the settlement of villages on the banks of the river when Farrukshiyar became the emperor. Around 1728, the region that now forms present day Howrah district was considered part of either the Muhammad Aminpur Zamindari or the Burdwan Zamindari. The area came under complete control of the East India Company in 1760 after the battle of Plassey and the Hooghly and Howrah district was formed twenty-seven years later. Howrah was, however, separated from Hooghly district in 1843 and continues to be an independent district in the state.What makes Howrah truly unique are its people and its culture. The state is the birthplace of Rabindra Nritya Natya and Tagore Songs composed by Gurudev, Rabindranath Tagore. Howrah was once the motherland of Kazi Nazrul Islam who wrote and composed the Nazrul Geeti. Music and dance take precedence of course because classical dance and music coming from the region are famous all over the world. There are no festivities without them and, it is also believed, that there is no life without them. Locals have a special inclination towards theatre and drama too. It is, therefore, no surprise why there are so many artists coming from the region. If one wants to delve deep into the enticing and captivating artforms from the region, they may choose to visit the Anand Niketan Kirtishala Museum. It is the most recommended attraction in the town to know about this rich cultural and historical heritage.With a rich cultural heritage, it is evident that Howrah will have many colourful festivals celebrated with great enthusiasm. Mid-April brings the Poila Baisakh which is the Bengali New year. The day is considered auspicious for new establishments, projects etc. which begin with offering prayers and sweets to Goddess Kali. Durga Puja, which is celebrated in September-October is another festive time which shouldn’t be missed here. The town bustles with activities and colourful pandals housing intricately decorated idols of Goddess Durga and the traditional drums, bells and conch shells before every ritual. It is the call to unite and offer prayers to the goddess during this week-long festive time. Then follows Kali Puja/ Jagaddhatri Puja/ Diwali in October/ November. December is Christmas time and New Year in January with February bringing the auspicious time to worship Goddess Saraswati. Then there’s the Dol celebration which coincides with Holi in March. June brings in Eid-ul-Fitr after a holy month of Ramadan followed by Independence Day on 15th August.","Howrah is connected to other regions in West Bengal by road, rail and by air. For tourists coming from outside the state, rail and air travel is perfect. The airport nearest to Howrah is the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata. It is located about 23 kilometres away from Howrah and is connected to all the major airports in the country. To travel to Howrah from the airport, taking a taxi ride or hiring a private taxi is much recommended. But, as mentioned above, ample buses are also available to reach Howrah from Kolkata."

The The destination is visited by millions of tourists every year from all across the world in what is famously known as the 'Amarnath Yatra'. The Amarnath cave situated in this town is considered to be a devout location for the pilgrims, most notably Hindus.

How about you visit the place, and end up finding your very own formula to eternity?",Srinagar,"Amarnath Yatra,","Amarnath is probably the most popular abode for a pilgrimage trip. What makes a trip up there more valuable is perhaps the numerous mythological and historical stories attached to it.
The most popular story is perhaps of the Amarnath cave. It is said, that Parvati, the wife of Lord Shiva, once questioned him upon the necklace of beads that he used to wear, and what it stood for. Shiva then informed her that each bead stood for a skull that he added to his necklace everytime Parvati was reborn. She further questioned him upon the story behind his immortality. To relay this story (Amar Katha), Shiva found a cave (Amarnath cave) as a perfect spot, which would ensure secrecy. He also created Rudra, who happened to fire up the entire cave in order to make sure that no living being could listen to this tale. It so happened, however, that a pigeon egg was left hidden, and later hatched into a pair of pigeons. It is said that these pigeons became immortal upon hearing the “Amar Katha”. A number of pilgrims have claimed to have seen those pigeons.
Another story, about 700 years ago, tells about the discovery of the Amarnath cave by a shepherd, Buta Malik, who received a bag full of coal from a sage. The bag turned full of gold as soon as he reached home. Overcome with delight, he returned to thank the sage, only to find a cave with a Shiva Linga.This year, Shri Amarnathji Yatra will commence from June 28, registration of which will begin from March 1, 2018. 437 designated branches of Punjab National Bank, Jammu and Kashmir Bank and YES Bank, located in 32 states and union territories have been authorized by the board to take all the necessary steps for registration.

Various flintstone tools have been extracted across UAQ. Evidence of a full-fledged ceramic industry that existed as early as the 3rd century B.C have also been found in the area. The modern history of Umm al-Quwain began around 200 years ago. The Al-Ali tribe shifted from the Al-Sinniyah Island to their present location due to a scarcity of water resources. A sheikhdom in Umm al-Quwain was established in 1775 by Sheikh Majid Al Mualla. Sheikh Abdullah I signed the General Maritime Treaty 8 January 1820 thus accepting a British protectorate. This was done to keep the Ottoman Turks out. The position of Umm al-Quwain on the route to India made it important enough to be recognised as a salute state with a three-gun salute just like Ajman, Dubai, Ras al-Khaimah and Sharjah. Sheikh Ahmad II joined the UAE federation which included its neighbours Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Fujairah on 2 December 1971.Nightlife is limited to a few sheesha bars in the city. The emirate otherwise has no nightlife and alcohol too is hard to come by, especially when compared to the rest of UAE. There are no public bars in the city.Although Umm al-Quwain isn’t exactly a shopper’s paradise, there's enough material to momentarily satisfy your shopping senses. The city has a couple of malls with good enough brands. The local shopping centres known as the souks can also prove to be very interesting places to shop with a wide variety of options across several types of Arabian clothing, cuisine and souvenirs.The most fascinating thing about the city would be the fact that it has no mega malls or world class resorts, in stark contrast to its neighbours. The place has a distinct retro feel to it and the old town area has very few landmarks, namely the fortand the museum. There's an island right off the coast named Al Sinniyah.

It bears signs of prehistoric life and culture in the Neolithic and Megalithic eras of the Iron age. Remains discovered at Guddermadi, a place two kilometres from the main city proves the existence of ancient life. 
Shimoga has been under the rule of various rulers and dynasties, from the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Kadambas of  Banvasi, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and rulers of the Vijayanagara kingdom. It was later annexed by Haider Ali and remained a part of the kingdom of Mysore until the Indian independence.

In his travels for the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi also visited this place.At first glance, Shimoga sounds like just another regular town name. But, have a closer look at the history of the name and it reveals not one or two, but four stories behind its name. The first three stories are linked to Lord Shiva, where the name is either a colloquial usage of Shiva-mukha, meaning the face of Lord Shiva, Shivani Moggu meaning nose of Lord Shiva or to Shivanna Mogge flowers which are offered to the great lord. Another story relates the name to the time of famous sage Durvavsa, known for his flaming temper. It is believed that Durvasa always kept a pot boiling full of sweet herbs and once, some cowherds came across the pot and called it Sihi Moge (sweet pot), after which Shimoga was later named.

Tucked amongst dense forests and gurgling streams, the temple town of Sabarimala on the Pampa banks named after the mythological character Sabari shelters the famous",Kochi,N/A,"The world famous Sabarimala pilgrimage is undertaken by thousands of ardent devotees every year. A strict-41 day fast is observed before the pilgrimage, which is believed to be a cleanser for the mind, body and soul. The devotees follow a lacto-vegetarian diet and practice celibacy and teetotalism. They also do not cut their hair or nails during this period, allowing them to grow. Their attire is composed of simple black or saffron garments, and they wear a special mala or chain made of Rudraksha beads. The devotees are expected to lead an altruistic lifestyle by helping others and doing service in the name of their Lord Ayyappan.

After the fast period, the devotees follow the difficult path through Erumely to reach the Pamba river, or else they arrive by vehicles. They then begin their long climb from the Neeli Mala to Sabari Mala, the abode of Lord Ayyappan.

Built on a hill inside the forests with the river Pampa flowing through, the lord Ayyappa temple is popular not only for the legends associated with it but also due to its serene location. Though the shrine can be visited for a limited number of days in the year, Sabarimala remains a favourite for trekkers and devotees who enjoy the walk through the lush green forests and hill tracks to reach the temple.The Ayyappa Temple is one of the very few Hindu temples in India that are open to all faiths and emphasizes on secularism and communal harmony. All men are seen equal before the Lord, irrespective of their caste, creed or race and hence all people visiting the temple refer to each other as ""Ayyappa Swami"". The temple is considered to be laid out according to the Lord's wishes and hence one can see that Goddess Malikappurathamma is placed left to the main Sannidhanam and the Lord's aides, Vavar and Kadutha stand at the foot of the 18 Holy steps (Pathinettu Thrippadi) that leads to the main sanctum. The temple was rebuilt after a massive fire in 1950 and stands on a plateau surrounded by mountains and valleys below. The sanctum sanctorum has a copper-plated roof with golden finials, two mandapams, the 'Kodimaram' or the flagstaff and the Belikalpura which houses the altar. The Ayyappa idol which was initially carved out of stone is presently made out of Panchaloha, an amalgamation of five metals and stands one and a half feet tall.Makara Vilakku is the most important festival that takes place in the Ayyappa Temple on Sabarimala. A seven-day festival, it begins on the day of Makara Sankranthi, when the sun is in the summer solstice. According to legends, it was on this day that the idol of Dharma Shasta was enshrined in the temple on this very day. An important highlight of this festival is the Makarjyothi, a star that is worshipped by millions on the day of Makara Sankranthi. The festival of Makara Vilakku is concluded with a ritual called 'Guruthi' where an offering is made to the Gods and Goddesses of the wilderness. Nobody is allowed to stay in and around the premises of the temple after Guruthi.While the entry of women into the Sabarimala Temple is still a burning issue, there are legends that tell us why women have been barred from the temple for ages. 1. Lord Ayyappa was born out of the union of Lord Shiva and Mohini, the feminine incarnation of Lord Vishnu. It is said that Lord Vishnu took this feminine form to mainly destroy a demon, Bhashmasura, who had acquired the elixir from the gods during the churning of the ocean. When Lord Ayyappa was a minor, a lady-demon started creating havoc in the south and could only be defeated by the son of Lord Shiva and Mohini. After Lord Ayyappa defeated her, she turned into a beautiful woman and revealed that she was cursed to live the life of a demon. She proposed to Lord Ayyappa who, without any second thoughts, refused. But as she persisted, he promised that he would marry her the day kanniswamis (new devotees) stopped visiting him at Sabarimala. The woman agreed to wait for him at the neighbouring temple and is worshipped today by many as Malikapurathamma. In honour of her, it is said that Lord Ayyappa does not receive any menstruating women. The women, too, do not prefer visiting the temple as that would mean insulting Malikapurathamma's love and sacrifice.Along your pilgrimage journey you will find dainty little restaurants dotting the way serving essentials of Keralan Cuisine. However, while the temple and the spiritual experiences surrounding it are the centers of attraction, there is an absence of any significant food culture and hence it might best to carry your own food.","Sabarimala has no airport or railway station.

Today, Mumbai is a beautifully blended melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The city soaks in everything into its fabric, making it its very own.

Besides being home to the largest cinema industry in the world, Mumbai, like Kolkata, has its own distinct culture. If you don't believe it, visit the city during festivals like Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Navaratri etc. and your doubts shall be dispelled for sure. Be it the majestic charm of the colonial heritage, like the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, or the indigenous beauty of places like Siddhivinayak Mandir, Wankhede Stadium to name a few, Mumbai is one city that never ceases to surprise you. Mumbai is a literal paradise for any foodie, owing to the exquisite range of cuisine, be it the luscious Missal Pav or the lovely Parsi cuisine in some of the heritage cafes. Being the one stop for all the dreams and ambitions in India, Mumbai is aptly called the 'City of Dreams'.The history of the city of Mumbai, or Bombay, began with the signing of the Treaty of Bassein between Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and the Portuguese, who were offered the seven islands that made up Bombay by the Sultan. The islands were initially referred to by several different names, but collectively took the written name of Bombain. The Portuguese built several churches and forts in the city during their reign. With its growing strategic importance as a natural harbour, it attracted repeated British and Dutch interests. In 1661, as part of the royal marriage alliance between Charles II of England and Princess Catherine of Portugal, the islands were given as dowry to the British by the Portuguese. In 1668, the English leased 3 of the islands to the British East India Company, and a few years later, they shifted their capital from Surat to Bombay. Bombay was thus the capital of the Bombay Presidency and quickly gained commercial and military significance. The Portuguese finally left Bombay in the 1730s, following their defeat to the Marathas under Peshwa Baji Rao. Following the Anglo-Maratha war and the signing of some treaties, the British drove out the Marathas and were able to establish their majoritarian supremacy over Bombay. Under the Hornby Vellard project, the islands were unified through significant land reclamation activities into a single landmass. Bombay was extremely active in the political sphere during India’s independence struggle and was part of the Quit India Movement & the Royal Navy Mutiny in the 1940s.Nothing can perhaps be a better yardstick for measuring Mumbai’s diversity and disparity than the fact that the city is home to both Dharavi and Antilia - the former one of the largest slum settlements in the world, and the latter the most expensive residential property of the multi-billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani. Dharavi Once a mangrove swamp and a sparsely populated island, Dharavi in Mumbai is now the second largest slum in Asia, and the third largest world in the world. Founded in 1883 during the British rule, Dharavi expanded rapidly due to rural migration and an explosion of factories in Bombay. According to suggested estimates, the population of Dharavi is said to be between 300,000 to 1 million. The citizens are multi-religious and multi-ethnic, who are engaged in various activities ranging from leather, textiles, pottery and even a growing recycling industry. The informal economy of Dharavi is thriving and goods from Dharavi are exported to many parts of the world, and the total annual turnover from the economy is around USD 1 billion. Despite many plans to resettle the population and develop the place, Dharavi still continues to be plagued by low sanitation and hygiene standards. Antilia The extravagantly expensive home of Mukesh Ambani, one of the world’s richest businessmen, is located in South Mumbai. Named Antilia, after the mythical islands of the same name, it is estimated to have a net worth of over USD 1 billion and is second only to the Buckingham Palace as the world’s most expensive residential property. A daily staff of around 600 are reported to maintain the private residence for the Ambani family. Embroiled in controversies over the legality of the land purchase since its inception, its tall architectural design was envisioned by the Chicago-based Perkins and Will, and it continues to attract both dubious criticism and envious wonder by the worldFollowing the establishment of Bombay as the capital of the English East India Company in 1687, and after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, there has been no stopping the rapid growth of the city of Bombay or Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial and financial capital of India and contributes to 6.6% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Initially, the primary contributors to Mumbai’s revenues were the textile mills and the seaport, but following the  Indian economy liberalisation in 1991, there has been an increasing growth in finance, IT, engineering as well as gems and stone. Many Fortune 500 companies have their headquarters in Mumbai, as do important financial institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Bombay Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), among others. Mumbai was ranked the third most expensive office market in the world in 2009, and 7th in  Forbes’s list of Top 10 Cities for Billionaires, and the 1st regarding their average wealth in 2008.The city of Mumbai has a richly diverse and delightful palate of architectural styles. The buildings constructed during the colonial period, such as the Victoria Terminus, are built in the Gothic-revival style and have a European blend including German gables, Dutch roofs and Tudor casements. In South Mumbai, there are many offices and buildings of the Soviet style.The famous Gateway of India is constructed in the Indo-Saracenic style, while landmarks along Marine Drive are modelled along the Art-Deco lines. After Miami, Mumbai hosts the most number of constructions in the Art-Deco style. Mumbai is also famous for contemporary and modern architecture and has the most number of skyscrapers in India. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Elephanta Caves of Mumbai are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.While a day in Mumbai is evidently abuzz with activities and the hustle and bustle of the crowds, even the nights here are far from quiet.

The sage asked for gopichandana, or clay, which unbeknownst to the sailors, covered a majestic statue of Lord Krishna that they had been transporting from Dwaraka, which is Lord Krishna’s birthplace.

The Basohli style paintings are famous, as are the ones with Mughal influence and murals. The paintings depict themes from Hindu mythology such as love scenes between Radha-Krishna, Shiva-Parvati, and have animals such as deer and different birds prominent in them. The romantic monsoon season is also a common backdrop of the paintings. They are available on display in different museums across Chamba. Chamba is also known for its exquisite handicraft items including weapons made out of metals like copper, brass and iron. Large plaques used for wall decoration and temple kupolas are also made with these metals. Chamba has its own local footwear, traditional shawls and handkerchiefs, jewellery and wood carvings. Musical instruments like Nagara (a form of kettle drum), cymbals and many other traditional ones are made in the town.Chamba’s ancient history can be traced back to the 2nd century BC when it was under the rule of the Kolian tribes. Following periods of rules under different dynasties such as the Guptas, the Thakurs and the Ranas, the town passed into the hands of the Rajputs in the 7th century. According to recorded history, the rule of the Rajputs can be traced to an individual called Maru, who migrated from Kalpagrama in north-west India around 500 AD. It is believed that Champa became the capital of the Rajput dynasty in 920 AD under the rule of Raja Sahil Verman, the king of Bharmour, which is situated around 75 km east of Champa. There are some legends associated with this, which say that he shifted the capital in honour of his daughter, who was called Champavati. The isolated location of the town, behind hilly and rugged terrains, contributed to its successful evasion of capture, mainly by the Mughals. It is believed that both Emperors Akbar and Aurangzeb had tried to annex Champa. Friendly ties with Emperor Shah Jahan in later years led to the introduction of Mughal lifestyles in the region. Champa was weakened in later years through attacks by the Gurkhas, and then the British. In the mid 1800s the leaders of Champa agreed to British suzerainty in the region, and under the Treaty of Lahore ceded the territory to the British. They remained on good terms with the Britishers in the subsequent years, and the region witnessed progressive reforms and development. After India’s independence, the princely state of Chamba agreed to merge with the country in August 1948.Chamba celebrates two renowned festivals with aplomb. The first is the Suhi Mata Mela, held during March/April for four days. It commemorates the sacrifice made by the Rajputi Queen of Chamba, who gave up her life so that the town could receive water from the Sarota stream. Hence women and children play a prominent role in this festival. An image of their queen, with the Rajput solar emblem, is printed on banners and carried in a procession, through dances and songs, to the Suhi Mata temple. The other famous festival celebrated is the Minjar Mela, celebrated on the 2nd Sunday of the Shravana month, or August. It celebrates the triumph of the king of Chamba over the Trigarta ruler in the 900s AD. It also marks the paddy and maize harvests, and offerings of minjar - paddy, golden silk, rupee coin, coconut and a seasonal fruit wrapped in red cloth - are made. A week full of festivities follow a flag hoisting ceremony at the Chaughan. Lord Raghuvira is mainly worshipped, and on the last day, tribute is also paid to the Ravi river. The locals perform many folk dances and songs, known as Kunjari Malhar during the festival.Chamba, being located in Himachal Pradesh has predominantly North Indian Cuisine. However, you can also find some local Himachal cuisine over here too. Madra, a native delicacy of Chamba is made of lentils like Rajma and Kidney Beans, cooked in a lot of spices and dry fruits.

English is also the language of business and government in Singapore, based on British English.According to the historical records, the story of Singapore goes as back as the third century, then referred to as 'island at the end'. It was between 1298 and 1299 AD that the first settlement was established when the city came to be known as Tumasik or Sea Town. According to a legend, the current name of the country came into being during the 14th century when a prince of Palembang (capital of Srivijaya) saw an animal he had never seen before while on his hunting trip. Taking it as a good omen, he named the city as 'Singapura' or the 'lion city' derived from the Sanskrit words 'Simha' meaning 'lion' and 'pura' meaning. Soon, the city located at the tip of the Malay Peninsula (natural meeting point of various sea routes) became the major trading hub for Arabs dhows, Chinese junk, Portuguese battleships and Buginese schooners. However, the modern city of Singapore was founded in 19th century by Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles. After passing from various hands of power, the island was handed over to British in 1946 as its crown colony.

Different accounts associate different stories with the origin of the name.

One story claims that Medinipur is so named after goddess Medinimata (meaning mother of the worlds, an incarnation of goddess Shakti).

Even though the deep influence of Jainism and Buddhism is imprinted here, some accounts associate the name Midnapore to that of Medina, the Islamic holy city. It is said that during its prime days, Midnapore housed mosques which rivalled the mosques in Medina due to their sheer numbers and that is how it came to be known as Midnapore.

It is also said that Medinikar, a ruler of the Kar dynasty which ruled Midnapore during 1200 and 1431 AD named it as Medinipur.During ancient times, as the historical sites and structures show, Jainism and Buddhism were highly dominant in these parts of the country. Midnapore is renowned for its benefaction to the history of freedom fighters in India. It has created several brave martyrs. A vastly distinctive culture can be seen in Midnapore. The official languages spoken here are Bengali and English, though Hindi is widely understood.   Midnapore is also notable for its Bengali sweets shops.

But, one local preparation, known as Gohona Bori gives the tiny town of West Midnapore something to boast of, i.e., a food item true and authentic to the Bengali cuisine. Gohona means jewellery in the local language and Bori means small round shapes (derived from Batika in Sanskrit). Like many local crafts, the craft of making these Boris is fast disappearing. But, some local cooperatives are trying to revive it by offering them for sale. Difficult as it might be to source it, a trip to Midnapore will be complete if you get to experience this authentic Bengali delicacy.","Travelling to Medinipur by air directly is not possible. The nearest operational airport is the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Airport, Kolkata.

Thus, this town got the name Aihole. However, this place is also called ‘Ayyavole’ and ‘Aryapura’.Aihole is considered as 'The cradle of Hindu rock architecture'.  Legend has it that more than 125 temples were built during Badami Chalukyas rule, between 5th and 8th centuries. These temples represent different architectural styles like that of Dravidian, Phamsana, Gajaprastha and Nagara. The exquisite sculpture from this period has a classical quality. Richly carved ceilings, isolated figures and flat roofs, are some of the standard features of the temples. The grandeur of the Chalukyan architecture is beyond excellence.The options for food and cuisines here are somewhat limited here.

Most of the restaurant, hotel and guesthouse staff will speak English. Althouh, may local vendors and drivers might not know English, so learning a few basic Thai phrases will work in your favour.A city for all the history buffs, Sukhothai was the first capital of the kingdom of Siam. It was established in the 13th century and was the capital of Siam for 120 years, during which the city was ruled by many kings. King Ramkhamhaeng was the greatest of them all who laid the foundation of the political, cultural and religious ideas of Sukhothai. In todays day, there are around 200 historical sites and ruins in the city of Sukhothai, making it the most visited ancient city in Thailand.A UNESCO World Heritage Site and a rural temple town like Sukhothai does not have a great nightlife scene. The walking street serving delicious food and the light and sound shows here are more kind of the nightlife that travellers have to look at. However, there is one good bar along the new city road called Chopper Bar serving cheap alcohol.The walking street offers brilliant handicraft stalls. Popular souvenirs to take from Sukhothai are Sangkhalok ware and gold and silver jewellery which are hand-woven. Embroidered fabrics can be found at the Hat Siao textile village.Major cards are accepted at most hotels, restaurants and shops. However, hard Baht is preferred by local vendors. Traveller checks are not very commonly accepted, so carrying cash in hand is always advisable.Bank branches and ATMs are easily available across the city. You can exchange money at these places.

You are also expected to protect the monuments and not litter and dirty the plcae. Locals should be respected and you should talk to them with kindness and generosity.

The town has a dark past as it played house to one of the most brutal prisons in the world. Today, all that remains is the ruins and a tiny town with ghosts of its past deceptively hidden behind its natural rivers, trees and flowers.",N/A,N/A,"The commonly spoken languages in Son La are Vietnamese and FrenchThe Hoa Ban is a white and pink flower that is authentic to the Northwest Vietnam region. It is often considered to be the symbol of Son La. Another prominent symbolism of the Hoa ban is the purity and love of a northwestern Vietnamese girl. The flower blooms in March, at the onset of spring and this is when the festival is held. The ïDien BienÍ ethnic minority celebrates this festival with great pomp. They go on a ïpilgrimageÍ to pick flowers, providing an opportunity for young boys and girls to meet and fall in love. Towards the end of the day, boys blow pan pipes and sound gongs and the girls dance to the tunes.To Hieu is a prominent revolutionary who played a pivotal role in the Vietnamese liberation from French colonialists. In his last days, he was sentenced to live in the Son la prison. During this period, he was suffering from severe tuberculosis but he refused to give up. He was elected as the Secretary of his PartyÍs Cell and fought for better facilities in the prison. He changed the prison into a ïschoolÍ, teaching the inmates lessons in politics and culture. The French envoy in Son La increased his suppression on the prioners, forcing them to go into a hunger strike. This worsened his condition, however, he held onto hope that the Vietnamese revolution would be successful. He took his last breath on march 7th 1944 and was buried under the peach tree that he had tended to during his time at the prison. The tree still stands tall to this day.Son La is haunted by the ghosts of dead prisoners. In the early 1930Ãs the French colonialists found the Khau Ca hills, a murky area near Son La with extreme weather conditions, and built a prison here. They imprisoned revolutionaries and popular leaders here. The prison was nicknamed ÃHell on EarthÃ, not only because of its extreme weather conditions which made the cells unbearably hot during summer and freezing during winter but also because of the magnitude of torture inflicted on the inmates by the jail officials. The revolutionaries at that time saw the prison as a test of their patriotism and willpower towards their cause.Son la is a quaint town that goes to sleep early, providing you with a bare minimum of nightlife. Son la has two prominent options to choose from _ Trung Nguyen Caf_ and Karaoke Nice Bar. Both of these club-bars have minimal crowds except during the weekends when the country folk flock to the area.

She is considered a national War hero due to the service she provided to the Vietnamese army during times of war. The 60-year-old woman risked her life every day, ferrying soldiers and artillery in a small wooden boat across the Nhat Le river. When the American Army bombed the wharf, all the ferrymen fled but only Mother Suot remained, ferrying soldiers across in her wooden boat no matter how hard the bombs rained. She was killed on 11th October 1968 by a US bomb pellet. Even to this day, she is recognized as a Vietnamese War hero.

It doesn't matter what you're in the mood for as a tourist, Kathmandu offers it all. From venturing into the untamed wild in National Parks, going where nature takes you on hikes and trails, setting your senses ablaze with the thriving nightlife and conquering the gushing waters on rafts and kayaks, to rediscovering yourself in the tranquillity of the mountains, detoxifying your system with the fresh air, finding your spirituality and contemplating life, Kathmandu is truly a place and an emotion - all at once.",Kathmandu,N/A,"ATMs are easily available in the city and cash is dispensed in NPR only. Major currencies such as GBP, USD, Euro, Yen or INR can be changed at the money changers'. ATMs of most banks levy a fee of NPR 750 per transaction, and limit withdrawals to NPR 25000, so it's better to withdraw a fair bit of cash in one transaction. Be careful of pickpockets and also be careful while using your cards.Per day costs in Kathmandu can actually be covered even in the lowest of budgets. Using local public transport systems, and local restaurants for food, shopping for souvenirs and covering the essentials, including costs of your mobile phone, entertainment and modest tipping, you can expect a per day expense between NPR 1300-1500 per head.

Shaking of hands as a greeting is practiced too, however a man should not offer his hand to a woman unless he is offered it first. Tips are often given in Nepal. In restaurants and hotels, 5 - 10% of the bill is sufficient. You can tip your guide anywhere between NPR 300 - 500 per day.One of the best things to do in Kathmandu is to make the best use of the terrain and go hiking.

The Narayanhiti Royal Palace was the home and the workplace for the Monarch of Nepal and his family. The rule of different dynasties in Nepal has existed from centuries ago, with the Malla Dynasty being the first proper rulers of the land back in 1200. The 18th century saw the rise of the Gorkhas, who conquered a massive amount of land in the region and even Tibet, an action which saw severe retaliation by the Chinese and consequent defeat of the Gorkhas who had to retreat and relinquish control of Tibet and many trading centres. The Gorkhas were then replaced by the Shahs, and the Ranas who had most of the influence and power. Throughout the 20th century we have seen several changes in power, culminating finally in the first Parliament elections in 1991 under the new constitution. One extremely horrifying incident that has occurred in the history of the city was the massacre of the royal family in 2001, in which the Crown Prince Dipendra shot and killed his father and King, Birendra, his mother, his brother and sister, and 5 other relatives in the Narayanhiti Royal Palace, and then killing himself 2 days later. The reason for this was suspected to be the family's rejection of his love interest, a Rana girl. Kathmandu and Nepal in general are pestered with constant political unrest, protests, and maoist insurgencies. In modern times however, the city is growing exponentially with the construction of many luxury and residential building complexes and so on.Kathmandu isn't extensively known for it's array of options when it comes to nightlife. That said, it does have a few options if you're looking for a place to hang out at and have a few drinks.

If it's a night club you're looking for, the Tamas Spa Lounge in Thamel is probably your best option. A huge variety of cocktails and drinks, DJs and live performances, and an elaborate ambience make this a must visit if it's a party you're looking for.Shopping in Kathmandu is an absolute must. The things you can shop for are limitless. Thamel is the centre for all things shopping. You'll find everything, from handicrafts to metal works, from paper works to clothes here.

The trail is very well defined, and there are small arrows indicating the direction to Rajmachi fort on a few points where you might be unsure where to head.From the Pune side, the trek is much shorter. You can drive your car all the way up to Udhewadi village. However, be warned - the 15 km route from Lonavala to Udhewadi is extremely bad and we would recommend you only take this route on an SUV or a car with a high ground clearance. From there, the route to the top of the forts is hardly 30 minutes, and the tourism department has built new steps on almost half the way. This is by far the more convenient way to reach the top of the forts - however this route wouldn't really give you much feel of ""trekking"".The mighty fort was built by the Satavahanas who established their kingdom soon after the Mauryan Dynasty came to an end and ruled the kingdom till 230 BC. This kingdom started getting recognized when it was taken over by Shivaji Maharaj in 1657 from the ruler of Bijapur, Adil Shah. Under the rule of Shivaji, the Rajmachi fort was made defensive and a few structures were added for battalion purpose. It was under the rule of the Mughals from 1704 to 1705 before the Marathas gained control after their fight with Aurangzeb. After the Marathas, the fort was taken over by the British when the Maratha Kingdom declined in the 19th century. Soon after independence, magnificent the fort was announced as an ancient and protected monument in Maharashtra. 

The forts have an eventful history and a brilliant architecture because of which they have been recognized all over. The Buddhist caves dedicated to the local deity are situated on the Western side of the Rajmachi plateau and were carved during 200 BC.The Rajmachi Fort has a brilliant architecture and comprises of vast and robust walls, gigantic gateways, residential units, administrative centres, water reservoirs and some secret gateways which were used for exiting purpose at that time. The fort is built upon two hill stretches namely Shrivardhan Hill and Manaranjan Hill. Shrivardhan Fort and Manaranjan Fort inside the Rajmachi Fort have been constructed in a traditional Indian style. It is a stone marvel. Inside the forts are a few ruined complexes. Since the area is considered as a heavy monsoon area, it has a number of man-made as well as natural water catchment areas. Some manmade lakes have been built in the area for the summers. A famous temple known as Kal Bhairavi Temple too has been established here which is decorated beautifully on auspicious occasions.  

The various functionaries and officers in the military and administrative set-up for Rajmachi region under the Maratha rule resided at Rajmachi till the British defeated the Peshwa in the year 1818. Ruins of their big residential houses are found in the forest on the south side of the hamlet Udhewadi. A big water reservoir constructed about 200 years ago is situated further down from the forest mentioned above. A carved stone plate in the wall of the water reservoir indicates that it was built by Ramrav Narayanrav Deshmukh, Mamlatdar of Danda Rajpuri (near Murud Janjira in Raigad District). An ancient Shiva temple, built in Hemdpanti style, is situated on the western side of the water reservoir. A large amount of silt coming in the stormwater from the high land behind was deposited around the Shiva temple. The inhabitants of Udhewadi have now cleared the silt. A fountain in the shape of cow-head and a water tank in the front of the temple have been discovered.In Udhewadi, the village at the base camp, some villagers can make delicious home-cooked food for you - mostly egg/chicken curry or usal, dal along with bhakri and rice. You can also opt for snacking options like pohe, bhajis and maggi. Also available are refreshing drinks like kokam sharbat and neebu paani. You might be able to get misal pav and vada pav as well. The food is simple but has an extremely authentic Marathi flavour - a great pit-stop after a tiring trek.","There are two approaches to Rajmachi forts - from Mumbai you can drive upto Kondhane side and do the longer trek (3 - 4 hours) or from Pune/Lonavala you can drive up to Udhewadi village and do the shorter trek (30 - 40 minutes). Both the roads are a little rough (although the one from Pune side is definitely worse) and we would recommend driving an SUV only, especially in the rains. For more details about the treks from the two sides, please read the ""Overview"" section. Nearest airport to Rajmachi is the Mumbai Airport, after which you take the train or road towards Lonavala or Karjat. New Pune International Airport Tentative return flight prices to Pune from major cities in India: Rajmachi lies between Khopoli and Khandala on the Mumbai-Pune route.

A devout priest from a nearby village, Hansali, Pandit Shridhar was blessed by Goddess Vaishnavi for organizing a Bhandara in her honour. Her sudden disappearance depressed Shridhar to the core, and he took a fast unto death, hoping for the Goddess to reappear. Distressed by his vow, Goddess Vaishnavi reappeared in his dream and instructed him the way to discover her abode in the cave on Trikuta Hills. The moment he got up, he set off for the journey to the Holy Cave. After days of toiling and travelling long distances, he found the Cave. It is then that Goddess Vaishnavi appeared in her true form and blessed him with four sons, and gave him the boon of being the official custodian of her Holy Cave. To this day, the successive generations of Pandit Shridhar honour this commitment.Known as 'The Wish-Fulfilling Goddess' or ' Mann Mange Murad Poore Karne Wali' in Hindi, Vaishno Devi is a pilgrimage hotspot located in Trikuta Hills at Katra, in the state of Jammu & Kashmir, India.

It is presumed that Arbuda accomplished the command of Shiva in closing the gorge that existed there and this event was cherished by christening the hill ‘Arbuda’.
